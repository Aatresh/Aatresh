## Hi, I'm Aatresh :smile:
- I'm a Doctoral candidate at the University of Cincinnati working on understanding supersonic jet noise
- This repo is a collection of codes I created in MATLAB to analyze visual & acoustic data using methods based on Fourier Analysis(temporal & spatial)
- This includes decomposition & receonstructions of different modes of flow oscillations including the extraction of oscillation intensity & phase information
- Although developed for data accquired at high acquisition rates, the uncerlying principles can be utilized to reveal interesting features in many types of data sets
